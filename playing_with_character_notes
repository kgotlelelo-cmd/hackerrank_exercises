you can take a string as input in c using scanf("%s",s). but, it accepts string only untill it finds the first space, in order to take a line as input use scanf("%[^\n]%*c",s); where s is defined as char s[MAX_LEN] where MAX_LEN is the maximum size of s. here [] is the scanset character ^\n stands for taking input until a newline isn't encountered. then with this %*c, it reads the newline character and here, the used * indicates that this newline character is discarded.
